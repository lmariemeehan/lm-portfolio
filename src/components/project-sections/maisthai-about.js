                I love this restaurant. Little hole in the wall Thai place that I have been going to for a little over a decade. It is owned and operated by a very sweet family that has been in business for over 30 years. With the beginning of the awareness of Covid in my area, I thought that businesses such as restaurants that did not currently have a website could benefit from having one. So I looked around and noticed that my favorite Thai place did not have one. At the time, I dabbled with Wordpress and wanted more practice so with permission I built them this.
